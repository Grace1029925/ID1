            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <h5>My path on becoming a designer</h5>
            <p>The day I discovered graphic design was for me was four years ago. I was sitting in my 12th grade Multimedia Desktop class. In that class I learned the basics about coding and graphic design. From a young age I have always had a gift for putting different visuals together to tell a story. The reason for that is I am a very visual person and usually in every project I do I have always gone above and beyond on the visual aspect of it. In my opinion, visuals help relay what a person is thinking or feeling. Graphic design is the perfect for me because there are so many different directions that one can take with it. Soon after taking my coding class I began to design different illustrations for the clubs I were in at the time.</p>
            <h5>My aspiratons</h5>
            <p>As of now I am not sure on what path I want to take in the Graphic Design world. I know I would love to do something in the advertisement world. After taking this class I am very interested in web design; because there are so many aspects to it. my next goal is to obtain a internship in a ad agency. The reason I want to work in a ad agency because I belive I could learn alot and get some experience. Another aspirato of my mine to fill my portfolio with numerous pieces of work that represent me as a designer.</p>

        <h3>Born to Sing</h3>
        <p>My favorite music artist is Adele. On May 5, 1988 Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born in North London, England to her eighteen year old mother Penny Adkins. Early on in Adele’s life she developed an amazing passion and drive for music. Adele’s favorite singers growing up were Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige and Destiny’s Child. Eventually she went on to enroll in the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology, which is the same school Amy Winehouse attended.</p>
        <blockquote>"Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow it to the dark places where it leads"</blockquote>
        <h3>Star Over Night</h3>
        <p>Only four months after she graduated from school, Adele signed her first record deal. All three of Adeles albums are named after her age when she began to write them. Adeles first album was entitled &ldquo;19&rdquo;, which went on sale in 2008. After performing one of her songs on Saturday Night live shortly after the release, it went from NO. 40 on iTunes to NO. 1. So far, Adele has come out with two more albums <en>&ldquo;21&rdquo;</en> and <en>&ldquo;25&rdquo;</en>. She has sold millions of records and won multiple Grammys.</p>

        <p>Adele’s albums <en>&ldquo;19&rdquo;</en> and <en>&ldquo;21&rdquo;</en> were both break-up records and if I had to describe her latest album <en>&ldquo;25&rdquo;</en> I would call it a make-up record. On her album <en>&ldquo;25&rdquo;</en> she is making up with herself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything she ever did and never did. <en>&ldquo;25&rdquo;</en> is about getting to know who she has become because of her past; but now she has realized that she does not have time to hold on to the past. What’s done is done. Adele beleives in trilogies, so &ldquo;25&rdquo; will be the last album named after her age.

        <h3>Breath of Fresh Air</h3>
        <p>Adele’s music is very easy to relate to. I think Adele is honestly a hopeless romantic that keeps getting her heart-broken over and over by the same type of guys. Most of her songs are about her past relationships or actions and how she wished she could do things differently. Adele got to where she is today with a lot of hard work and dedication and being a brilliant song writer. In every one of her songs you can hear every emotion she went through, whether the emotion was a year ago or today.</p>
        <blockquote>"She broke her own heart, holding on to him."</blockquote>

        <h3>The Very First Time</h3>
        <p>The first time I heard one of Adele’s songs I was driving home and <en>&ldquo;Rolling in the Deep&rdquo;</en> came on the radio. Immediately, my heart was touched by the lyrics, as if the song was written for me. I felt like every word she was saying was coming from my own personal diary. Every time I listen to one of her new songs I always say,<en>&ldquo;She has done it again.&rdquo;</en> When I listen to her music it makes me think about my past, present and future life. Through her music I have also learned more about self-value and how you should never let someone mistreat you physically or emotionally. Two of my favorite songs from her collection are <en>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo;</en> and <en>&ldquo;Make you feel my love.&rdquo;</en>In my opinion, both of these tracks are talking to past love ones and saying things you wish you could have said then. Some people may say that Adele's music has a sadness to it but belive that it shows the harsh reality of many people's life. Over time, I have seen her music mature in many ways. Music has always been a window to my soul and I enjoy listening to all genres. Adele’s music teaches you to be strong as a person and to ultimately never let someone break your spirit permanently.</p>

        <h3>Her Message</h3>
        <p> Through her music Adele also sends another message to males or females; which is, it is okay to have insecurities but do not let those insecurities control you. There is more to life than worrying about how you look. <blockquote>"There's only one of you, so why would you want to look like everyone else? 'Why would you want to have the same hair style as everyone else and have the same opinions as everyone else?"</blockquote> 
        <p>Her music is a reminder to people to always stay true to yourself. In many of her songs she expresses how she loves her body regardless of what anyone else thinks. I think this is an important message to relay in this day and age, because many people have this fantasy of the perfect body and in reality their is no such thing.</p>

        <h3>Work of Art</h3>
        <p>Adele has earned 91 awards, including 15 Grammys and one Oscar. She is considered by many to be one of the best singers in the world. Adele waited over four years between the release of 21 and 25. One of her greatest strengths: the ability to take her time and I can not wait to continue her musical journey with her.</p>

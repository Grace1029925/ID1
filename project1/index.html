        <h1><strong>Music Whisper</strong></h1>
        <h3>Born to Sing</h3>
        <p>My favorite music artist is Adele. On May 5, 1988 Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born in North London, England to her eighteen-year-old mother Penny Adkins. Early on in Adeles life she developed an amazing passion and drive for music. Adele’s favorite singers growing up were Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige and Destiny’s Child. Eventually she went on to enroll in the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology, which is the same school Amy Winehouse attended.</p>
        <h3>Star Over Night</h3>
        <p>Only four months after she graduated from school Adele signed her first record deal. Every album Adele has done so far has been named after her age when she first began the project. Adeles first album was entitled &ldquo;19&rdquo;, which went on sale in 2008. After performing one of her songs on Saturday Night live shortly after the release, it went from NO. 40 on iTunes to NO. 1. So far Adele has come out with two more albums &ldquo;21&rdquo; and &ldquo;25&rdquo;. She has sold millions of records and won multiple Grammys.</p>
        <h3>Breath of Fresh Air</h3>
        <p>Adeles music is very easy to relate to. I think Adele is honestly a hopeless romantic that keeps getting her heart-broken over and over by the same type of guys. Most of her songs are about her past relationships or actions and how she wished she could do things differently. Adele got to where she is today with a lot of hard work and dedication and being a brilliant song writer. In every one of her songs you can hear every emotion she is went through, whether the emotion was a year ago or today.</p>
        <h3>The Very First Time</h3>
        <p>The first time I heard one of Adeles song I was driving home and <en>&ldquo;Rolling in the Deep&rdquo;</en> came on the radio. Immediately, my heart was touched from the lyrics, as if the song was written for me. I felt like every word she was saying was coming from my own personal diary. Every time I listen to one of her new songs I always say <en>&ldquo;She has done it again&rdquo;</en>. When I listen to her music it makes me think about my past, present and future life. Through her music I have also learned more about self-value and how you should never let someone mistreat you physically or emotionally.  Two of my favorite songs from her collection are <en>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo;</en> and <en>&ldquo;Make you feel my love&rdquo;</en>. In my opinion both of these tracks are talking to past love ones and saying things you wish you could have said then. Some people may say that Adele's music has a sadness to it but belive that it shows the harsh reality of many people's life. Overtime I have seen her music mature in many ways. Music has always been a window to my soul and I enjoy listening to all genres.</p>

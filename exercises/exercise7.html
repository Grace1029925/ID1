        <h1>Exercise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
        <h2>96 Elephants</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>What adjective would you use to describe the design of this site?</h3></li>
            <p>The website was done in black white for the most part. In my opinion, I feel like the choice of color represents the underlining meaning of the story that is about to be told, dark but beautiful. Alot of the photgraphy is dark and the texture is animated.</p>
            <li><h3>Describe how the navigation for this "story" works.</h3></li>
            <p>The navigation of the website is designed well. I like how the links are built into alot the titles and also at the bottom of each chapter. The set up of the page is very user friendly. Also the color blocks seperate the sections very suddly but enough that the viewer would realize a new section is begining.</p>
            <li><h3>How does the ending for Chapter 3 differ from the endings for the other 2 chapters?</h3></li>
            <p>The end of the page has linked embeded into the images. The links takes you to website where you can donate and help save a elephant. A call to action is very obvious with helping to support a good cause.</p>
            <li><h3>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish?<h3></li>
                <p>I think the creator of this website I wanted the elephats story to be heard. This website also brings awareness to a need. The linear narrative expierence was done very well. The photography was done truely beautifully capturing the tone of the website.</p>
                </ol>
                <h2>Elizabeth River Trail</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>What adjective would you use to describe the design of this site?</h3></li>
                    <p>The website was plain and interactive. The color choices the designers used are very light and welcoming.</p>
                    <li><h3>Describe how the navigation for this works.</h3></li>
                    <p>The navigation of the website was very simple and clear. All of the tabs are in the upper right tabs. The navigation buttons are "sticky" or fixed to the top. The linear navigation combined with the images brought the entire website togetheir and easy to follow.</p>
                    <li><h3>Do the page names in the navigation seem appropriate for the content on these pages?</h3></li>
                    <p>Yes, I think the page names are apporiate for the website. Each tab is </p>
                    <li><h3>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accoomplish?</h3></li>
                    <p>The site was intended to inform people about the trail. The website was very informative. A call to action was located at the bottom of the page.</p>

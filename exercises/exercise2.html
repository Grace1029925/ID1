            <!---------------------Question 1--------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>I think the headers were all done beautifully with the color and font choice,it went with the flow of the page. The fonts are very clear and have a gothic feel to them. The typefaces match the artists sound which is dark and deep. The first quote was done well but the ones following kind of got lost and did not flow as well. In my opinion, each paragraph should of had some sort of headline to give the reader an idea for what to expect. The paragraphs could have been shorten some and still got their point across.</p>
            <!--------------------Question 2---------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette they used was black and white just like their music. The colors are different tones of whites, greys and blacks. The backgrounds used in the photos are all white with black shadow cast on them, which related once again back to the melancholy tone of their music. The background for everything is white. The color black is used for the font color and to cast shadows in the different photos. The only time black is used as the background is in the first side bar. The role of the visuals mirrored each paragraph with a playful tone.</p>
            <!--------------------Question 3--------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals are the two artist standing in front of blank background which result in the artist being the focal point of every photo. The subject in each photo became very repetitious after the fifth image of the same person and same pose. They chose to not have a lot of extra noise in the background. The quality of the visuals were not consistent throughout. The videos were very animated but the colors and text was very serious, which did not correlate with each very well. The images are not in line with the tone of the article.</p>
            <!--------------------Question 4--------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The sections are separated by photos and pull quotes. I like the layout of the site because it guides your eyes easily and swiftly through the page. Also by utilizing the columns in a downward motion there is no miscommunication on where your eyes should go next.</p>

        <h1>The State of the World Today</h1>
        <p>I love that the world itself is very diverse. I love that basically anything you can dream can be made into reality.</p>
        <p>I hate that world is slowly dying because people are not taking care of the earth like they should be but instead they are polluting it and gutting it of all of its natural resources. The sad part is eventually nothing will be left.</p>
        <p>I wish people could learn to truly love one another for their differences and similarities.</p>

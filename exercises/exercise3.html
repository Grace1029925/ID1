        <h1>Janelle Mon&aacute;e Website Analysis</h1>
        <ol>
            <!---------------------Question 1--------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The font used for the headers are very bold and large. I felt like the header portrayed her music very well. The color of the title was very strong and bold. The font used for the paragraph is very classy but plain. The pull-quote fonts are done in italic. I also noticed that the font in the pull-quotes were not consistent. All of the text was done in black except the title.</p>
            <!--------------------Question 2---------------------->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette is very soft but vibrant. The colors are very edgy but flow very well together. I like the use of gradients in the paragraphs. In some of the paragraphs a teal green was used which compliments the images very well. The color choice reminds me of a warm spring day.  All the photos also start off being black and white and transition to lively colorful images. The colors are very warm and feminine. There are a lot of different hues of greens, purples, oranges and grays used.</p>
            <!--------------------Question 3--------------------->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals are the images of the artist standing in a forest like scenery. The images help guide your eye through the layout. I do think that the artist should have done poses that were not all so similar. All of the images used are three-quarter view and using some close up and full body images may have made it more interesting.I understand why they used those views because they were trying to show her more feminine and romantic side, but I think switching it up would not have hurt.</p>
            <!--------------------Question 4--------------------->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The sections are separated by different images and pull quotes. The hues and color blocks give you a heads up that a change is about to occur.</p>

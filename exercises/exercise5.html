                <ol>
                    <li><strong>What adjectives would you use yo describe Bethany's portfolio?</strong></li>
                    <p>I would describe Bethany's portfolio has very clean-cut, short but informative and with a loud headline. The sense of humor headline was the first thing I noticed. </p>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design of the navigations.</strong></li>
                    <p>The design of the layout is set up in multiple short columns besides the first paragraph. There are three different tabs to choose from which take you different places. I like how the navigation buttons were easy to find.</p>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design of the introductory information.</strong></li>
                    <p>The introduction is very simple and to the point. I found it interesting that she has two introductory elements in her web page. The about me is in a small font size but still legible, which leads me to belive that the information was not a key focus for her.</p>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design and layout of the body content.</strong></li>
                    <p>I thought the design and layout of the body content was very square and clear- cut. Their not any moving motions or photos on her home web. This web design does not give a real sense of her personality in the design of the layout.</p>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design of the footer.</strong></li>
                        <p>The footers are all icons displayed at the bottom of the page. The footers also have links embedded in them.</p>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>How does the navigation change?</strong></li>
                    <p>Now the web site is navigated down instead of across. Also the three tabs are now three lines to safe space.</p>
                    <li><strong>How does the size of the headline text change?</strong></li>
                    <p>The headline is now more compressed in size.</p>
                    <li><strong>How does the size of the body text change?</strong></li>
                    <p>The size of the body content does not change much. The body content style and shape is going down instead of going across to better fit the needs and accessibility for a mobile device.</p>
                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the footer change?</strong></li>
                    <p>The footers are now stacked on top of each other instead of going across the whole page.</p>
                </ol>

                        <li><strong>What adjectives would you use yo describe Olivia's portfolio</strong></li>
                        <p>I would describer Olivia's portfolio has lively, colorful, bold and personal.</p>
                        <li><strong>Describe the layout and design of the introductory section.</strong></li>
                        <p>The introductory section is at the top of the page the a photo follows it. I think the order should have been revered.</p>
                        <li><strong>Describe the layout and design of the portfolio entries.</strong></li>
                        <p>I like how she set them side by side, which allows the viewers to compare and contrast the different entries easily. I also like how personable her page is, almost like a peak into her soul. She indicates that you are about to see a new entry by the change in color.</p>
                        <li><strong>Describe the layout and the design of the footer</strong></li>
                        <p>The footer contains information about herself with links embedded; instead of using icons she simply used words; which works just as well.</p>

                        <li><strong>How does the layout of the introductory section change?</strong></li>
                        <p>The intro paragraph is now more compressed in a column shape. The first photo that was at the top is now gone. It would have been nice if the designer could have found a way to resize the photo so it could have been accessible on the mobile version. I think the mobile the site flowed better.</p>
                        <li><strong>How does the layout of the portfolio entries change.</strong></li>
                        <p>Instead of the portfolio entries being side by side everything is in once column going straight down. She keeps the same concept where the change in color indicates a different entre.</p>

                        <h3>Desktop and Mobile</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Describe the layout of the website.</strong></li>
                            <p>The layout of the website is very minimal. There are not photos at all on the home page just text. Everything is in a two column setup. There also is a link to some of his works, which a nice touch.</p>
                            <li><strong>Describe the design of website. How does Danilo indicate hierarchy?</strong></li>
                            <p>All of the information about him are all found at the top of the page. The information dealing with his works of art are found more towards the bottom.</p>
                            <p>The website is very interactive. There are many links embedded into different words. Which gives the user something to do. I like even though it is simple it still somehow draws the viewer in.</p>
                            <li><strong>How does the layout change?</strong></li>
                            <p>Now everything in the layout is in a single column. As far as I can tell, no material lost in switching over from desktop to mobile, which is a good thing.</p>
                            <li><strong>How does the size of the text change?</strong></li>
                            <p>The size of the text stays the same only now the it is more compressed because of the smaller space.</p>

        <p id="special">Human trafficking is modern-day slavery and involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act. Human trafficking can happen to anyone no matter the race, age or gender. Men are often trafficked into hard labor jobs, while children are trafficked into labor positions in textile, agriculture and fishing industries. Women and girls are typically trafficked into the commercial sex industry, i.e. prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation.

        <h2 id="girls">Who's at Risk</h2>
        <p id="victums">There is no single profile for trafficking victims; trafficking occurs to adults and minors in rural, suburban, or urban communities across the country. Vulnerable groups that are at risk of becoming trafficked, include migrant workers, migrant women, new immigrants, at-risk youth and those who are socially or economically disadvantaged. Another widley at risk group is teenage runaways. Girls make up 98% of the vicutms sex trafficked and boy only the 2%.</p>

        <h2 id="how">Finding their Victims</h2>
        <ol>
            <li id="method"><span class="first">Loverboy Method</span> &#8208; through this method, the trafficker invests time in a relationship with the victim to get close to her and pretends to become her boyfriend. He convinces her to trust him and demands conditional love. (For example,<q>If you love me, you&rsquo;ll do this</q>).</li>
            <li id="recruit"><span class="first">Recruitment for False Jobs</span> &#8208; often times, traffickers exploit the fact that many people dream of a better life with more money. They create false job advertisements often times with opportunities that seem too good to be true (because they are!). These fake offers usually entice people by requiring little to no previous work experience or knowledge of a foreign language but offer housing and visa or travel procurement and they pay extremely well</li>
            <li id="prostitution"><span class="first">Recruitment for Prostitution</span> &#8208; prostitution is sexual exploitation and it can mean human trafficking, even in countries where it is legalized. Even though it is legalized in some countries, this does not mean illegal activities or abuses do not happen regularly or that women are being paid. It happens regularly that after girls accept a lucrative job in prostitution, their ID and papers are taken away from them and they are forced to work as sex slaves in inhumane conditions, without getting paid the money they were promised.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="control">Control</h2>
        <p id="beat">Violence or the threat of violence can be used at any stage of the trafficking process to control a victim. Victims, or their friends and/or relatives, may be the subject and targets of the threats and violence. Someitmes victims may not be directly threatened but still live in great fear of violence. Simply suggest- ing the traffickers know where a victim&#39;s family live or by telling stories about victims who have not complied in the past can imply threats. Traffickers may make an example of one person to encourage others to conform: the message does not have to be stated if someone else you have seen being exploited is severely beaten or even killed.</p>

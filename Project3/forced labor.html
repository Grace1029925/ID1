            <p id="what">Forced labour is any work or service which people are forced to do against their will, under threat of punishment. Almost all slavery practices contain some element of forced labour. It affects millions of men, women and children around the world. It is most often found in industries with a lot of workers and little regulation.</p>

        <p id="field">A lot of times migrant worker are targeted because they often do not speak the language, have few friends, have limited rights and depend on their employers. Women and children make up more than 80% of the forced labor industry. It is a global problem, although some regions have larger numbers of people affected than others. </p>

        <p id=less>Labor traffickers often make false promises of a high paying job or exciting education or travel opportunities to lure people into horrendous working conditions. Yet, victims find that the reality of their jobs proves to be far different then promised and must frequently work long hours for little to no pay. Their employers exert such physical or psychological control: including physical abuse, debt bondage, confiscation of passports or money, that the victim believes they have no other choice but to continue working for that employer</p>

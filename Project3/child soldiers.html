        <h2 id="red">Child Soldiers</h2>
        <p id="hell">Child soldiers are children under the age of 18; who are used for any military purpose. Some are in their late teens, while others may be as young as four. They are not only boys, many are girls. Some child soldiers are used for fighting to kill, suicide bombers, human shields and other acts of violence. Others are used as cooks, messengers, informants or spies, or in any other way their commanders want. Child soldiers are also used sometimes for sexual purposes.</p>

        <h2 id="who">Victims</h2>
        <p id="whose">In the last 15 years, the use of child soldiers has spread to almost every region of the world and every armed conflict. Though an exact number is impossible to define, thousands of child soldiers are illegally serving in armed conflict around the world. Children who are poor, displaced from their families, have limited access to education, or live in a combat zone are more likely to be forcibly recruited. Children who are not forced to be soldiers volunteer themselves because they feel societal pressure and are under the impression that volunteering will provide a form of income, food, or security, and willingly join the group.</p>

        <h2 id="gun">Little Weapons</h2>
        <p id="tech">Technological advances in weaponry and the rapid increase of small weapons have contributed to the increased use of child soldiers. Lightweight automatic weapons are simple to operate, often easily accessible, and can be used by children as easily as adults.Both girls and boys are used as child soldiers. In some countries, like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Uganda, a third or more of the child soldiers were reported to be girls. In some conflicts, girls may be raped, or given to military commanders as "wives".</p>

        <h2 id="pure">Innoncent Beings</h2>
        <p id="stop">Children are uniquely vulnerable to military recruitment because of their emotional and physical immaturity. They are easily manipulated and can be drawn into violence that they are too young to resist or understand. It is estimated that their are over 300,000 active children soldiers.</p>

            <p>Human trafficking is modern-day slavery which involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act from someone. Every year, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked in countries around the world, including the United States. It is estimated that human trafficking generates more than 32 billion dollars of profit per year, second only to drug trafficking which is the most profitable form of international crime. Human trafficking can happen to anyone no matter the race, age or gender. Men are often trafficked into hard labor jobs, while children are trafficked into labor positions in textile, agriculture and fishing industries. Women and girls are typically trafficked into the commercial sex industry, prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation. Unlike drugs a person can be sold over and over again. Human trafficking does not discriminate. Anyone can be taken at any time.

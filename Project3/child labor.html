        <p id="sitting">Child labor is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and is harmful to thier physical and mental development. In most cases children are unable to attend school because they are working. In its most extreme cases, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and/or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities, often at a very early age.</p>

            <h2 id="cup">Easy Targets</h2>
        <p id="shirt">Since children are more easily manipulated and require fewer resources to survive; the use of child labor is increasing with poverty and the demand for cheaper labor. Child labor is separated from forced labor more commonly because exploitation does not automatically come from another individual. Hazardous working environments essentially weakens minors a great extent. </p>

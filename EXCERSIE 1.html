        <h1>The state of the world today</h1>
        <p>I love that the world itself is very diversed. I love that bascially anything you can dream can be made into reality.</p>
        <p>I hate that world is slowly dying because people are not taking care of the earth like they should be but instead they are polluting it and gutting it of all of its natural resouces. The sad part is eventually nothing will be left.</p>
        <p>I wish people could learn to truely love one another for their differences and similarties.</p>
